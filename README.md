# Discord-Shell-POC
A script that can allow you to get remote access to a machine on Discord via them putting code in the console. Also allows you to crash the BetterDiscord client. I'm planning to add more connection methods along with a way to put this code in a BetterDiscord plugin so it can be more efficient.

If you would like to see proof of this, there are images below of the BetterDiscord client crasher and proof of me getting full access to my PC from another OS.

Shout out to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgBPo5i0T9Q&ab_channel=HellSec] for giving me the idea to make this! I never saw him release his script, so I decided to make my own.

# How to use
```
pick a script
if you need to edit in your own IP into the script, do it
send it to your victim and make sure they load it
```
# How to crash BetterDiscord

```
load one of the scripts that allows you to have access to the remote computers CMD
once you are connected to the victims machine from another computer (or your own if you are simply testing)
type something random, like 'fgisefxs'
type in the command 'exit'
The BetterDiscord client should crash and you should be instantly logged out of your account.
```
